## Acknowledgements

This release stands on the shoulders of many people who have worked tirelessly to help you have fun with random Dark Souls. In particular, it uses:

* The original Archipelago mod and server code by Marechal-L and many other contributors, which is the foundation of the whole thing.

* The single-player "static" randomizer by thefifthmatt a.k.a. gracenotes, which is incredibly impressive in its own right.

* ModEngine2 by grayttierney and katalash, which not only makes the "static" randomizer possible in the first place but also makes it easy to combine mods in creative ways.

* All the incredible and thankless reverse engineering, documentation, and tooling work done by countless people at The Grand Archives, in the ?ServerName? discord, and across the internet.

* Debugging help and coding assistance from members of the Archipelago discord server, particularly Exempt-Medic and eldsmith.
